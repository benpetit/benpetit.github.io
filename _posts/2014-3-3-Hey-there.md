title: About me
---

I'm a graduate student at Stanford University in the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME), formerly in the Applied Mathematics department of Ecole polytechnique, Paris.

<b>Everything else:</b>

- Guitar (electric, acoustic): I have have played the guitar since I was 12, and dedicated huge portions of my time to discovering new techniques and styles.
- Lots of sports, but especially running, tennis, handball and soccer.
- Of course, <b>hanging out with cool people</b>!
