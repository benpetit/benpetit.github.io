I am a graduate student at Stanford University in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) (ICME), formerly in the Applied Mathematics department at [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), Paris. Prior to entering Ecole polytechnique, I was a Mathematics/CS preparatory class (<i>Classe preparatoire</i>) student at [Lycee Sainte-Genevieve](http://www.bginette.com/) in Versailles.

My primary research interest is artificial intelligence. I am especially interested in building systems that can learn tasks from scratch (reinforcement learning) and/or use accumulated knowledge to efficiently learn new tasks (meta-learning).

I am also highly interested in the statistical aspects of financial markets. At Ecole polytechnique, I worked with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud on some applications of control theory to trading. In 2018, I spent 6 months at Tower Research Capital in New York, where I worked on some applications of nonlinear machine learning techniques to high-frequency trading.

I also really enjoy teaching. I was a teaching assistant in Mathematics at Lycee Sainte-Genevieve in the academic year 2016-2017, conducting weekly oral examinations for undergraduates (linear algebra, real analysis, probability and group theory among other things). More recently, I have been a teaching assistant at Stanford for CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques), in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019.

In my free time, I play a lot of music (acoustic and electric guitar). I also enjoy traveling and solving interesting puzzles.

<b>Selected research projects</b>

- Image completion with [neural processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01622.pdf) (at Stanford, see details [here](https://github.com/Arnaud15/CS236_Neural_Processes_For_Image_Completion)).
- Deep learning under massive label noise (at Tower Research).
- Optimal multi-asset trading with linear costs (with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud).
- Stochastic trust-region optimization algorithms, applications to traffic models (in collaboration with [Aimsun](https://www.aimsun.com/)).
- Fair share problems (under the supervision of Prof. De Seguins-Pazzis).
- An essay on the plactic monoid (RSK correspondence and the Erdos-Szekeres theorem).
