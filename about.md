I am a graduate student at Stanford University in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) (ICME), formerly in the Applied Mathematics department at [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), Paris. Prior to entering Ecole polytechnique, I was a Mathematics/CS preparatory class (<i>Classe preparatoire</i>) student at [Lycee Sainte-Genevieve](http://www.bginette.com/) in Versailles.

At Ecole polytechnique, I worked with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud on some applications of control theory to trading. In 2018, I spent 6 months at Tower Research Capital in New York, where I worked on some applications of nonlinear machine learning techniques to high-frequency trading.

<b>Areas of research:</b>

- Artificial intelligence (especially reinforcement and meta-learning).
- Quantitative / High frequency trading.

<b>Other interests</b>

- Playing the guitar (electric, acoustic).
- Many different sports, but especially running, tennis, handball and soccer.
- Travel photography.

<b>Selected research projects</b>

- Image completion with [neural processes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.01622.pdf) (at Stanford, see details [here](https://github.com/Arnaud15/CS236_Neural_Processes_For_Image_Completion)).
- Deep learning under massive label noise (at Tower Research).
- Optimal multi-asset trading with linear costs (with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud).
- Stochastic trust-region optimization algorithms, applications to traffic models (in collaboration with [Aimsun](https://www.aimsun.com/)).
- Fair share problems (under the supervision of Prof. De Seguins-Pazzis).
- An essay on the plactic monoid (RSK correspondence and the Erdos-Szekeres theorem).

<b>Teaching</b>

- I was a teaching assistant in Mathematics at Lycee Sainte-Genevieve in the academic year 2016-2017, conducting weekly oral examinations for undergraduate students. Topics included linear algebra, real analysis, probability and group theory.
- In Fall 2018, I was a teaching assistant for [CS221](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs221/) (Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques) with Prof. [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/).
- I am currently (Spring 2019) a teaching assistant for CS221, with Prof. [Dorsa Sadigh](https://dorsa.fyi/) and [Moses Charikar](https://profiles.stanford.edu/moses-charikar).
