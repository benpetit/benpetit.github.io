I am a graduate student at Stanford University in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) (ICME), formerly in the Applied Mathematics department at [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), Paris. Prior to entering Ecole polytechnique, I was a Mathematics/CS preparatory class (<i>Classe preparatoire</i>) student at [Lycee Sainte-Genevieve](http://www.bginette.com/) in Versailles.

At Ecole polytechnique, I worked with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud on some applications of control theory to trading. In 2018, I spent 6 months at Tower Research Capital in New York, where I worked on some applications of nonlinear machine learning techniques to high-frequency trading.

<b>Mathematics:</b>

- Probability, stochastic processes.
- Algebra, combinatorics.
- Analysis, optimization, control theory.

<b>Computer science:</b>

- Algorithms & theory of computation.
- Programming (Python, Java, C++, OCaml).
- Machine learning, deep learning.
- Concurrent and parallel programming, massive data processing.

<b>Everything else:</b>

- Guitar (electric, acoustic): I have have played the guitar since I was 12, and dedicate huge portions of my time to discovering new techniques and styles.
- Many different sports, but especially running, tennis, handball and soccer.
- Travelling!

<b>Areas of research:</b>

- Artificial intelligence (especially reinforcement and meta-learning).
- Quantitative / High frequency trading.

<b>Selected research projects</b>

- Deep learning under massive label noise (at Tower Research).
- Optimal trading (with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud).
- Stochastic trust-region optimization algorithms, applications to traffic models (in collaboration with Aimsun).
- Fair share problems (under the supervision of Prof. De Seguins-Pazzis, see summary in French here).
- An essay on the plactic monoid (RSK correspondence and the Erdos-Szekeres theorem, see report in French here).
