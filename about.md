I am a graduate student at Stanford University in the [Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://icme.stanford.edu/) (ICME), formerly in the Applied Mathematics department at [Ecole polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), Paris. Prior to entering Ecole polytechnique, I was a Mathematics/CS preparatory class (<i>Classe preparatoire</i>) student at [Lycee Sainte-Genevieve](http://www.bginette.com/) in Versailles.

My primary research interest is artificial intelligence. I am especially interested in building systems that can learn tasks from scratch (reinforcement learning) and/or use accumulated knowledge to efficiently learn new tasks (meta-learning). I am currently a research assistant in the [Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://ai.stanford.edu/), working with Prof. Emma Brunskill at the intersection of on- and off-policy reinforcement learning methods.

I am also highly interested in the statistical aspects of financial markets. At Ecole polytechnique, I worked with Prof. Jean-Philippe Bouchaud on [some applications of control theory to trading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.04821). In 2018, I spent 6 months at [Tower Research Capital](https://www.tower-research.com/) in New York, where I worked on some applications of nonlinear machine learning techniques to high-frequency trading. This year (2019), I spent 3 months at [Squarepoint Capital](http://www.squarepoint-capital.com/) in Singapore, where I worked on several predictive signals on Asian equity markets.

I really enjoy teaching. I was a teaching assistant in Mathematics at Lycee Sainte-Genevieve in the academic year 2016-2017, conducting weekly oral examinations for undergraduates (linear algebra, real analysis, probability and group theory among other things). More recently, I have been a teaching assistant at Stanford for CS221 (AI: Principles and Techniques), in Fall 2018 and Spring 2019.

In my free time, I play a lot of music (acoustic and electric guitar). I also enjoy traveling and solving interesting puzzles.
